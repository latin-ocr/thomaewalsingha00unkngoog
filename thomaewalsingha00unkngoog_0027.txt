the Saint Alban’s Chronicle, after having wholly aban-
doned it for the years 1327-1340. With apparently
unaccountable carelessness too, although the Aruudel
and printed texts have at this point (p. 221) reached
the year 1340 from other sources, they revert to
1337, and take up the narrative of the Saint Alban's
Manuscript at that point. A few lines must of
necessity be devoted to the authorities which have
led the Compiler of the Arundel Manuscript to abandon
the source from which he has thus far so closely and
so constantly drawn.- “

In MS. No. 655 of the Harleian Collection in the
British Museum, we find the ¹ Polychronicon, or
Polycratica, of Roger of chester, a Chronicle coming
down to the year 13383 the manuscript of which
appears to be of contemporary writing ‘with the
author's date, who is stated by ⁹ Pits to have flourished
(clav-ait) in the year 1339. ·To this work, which
seems to have been unknown to the Compiler of the
Saint Alban's Chronicle so osten mentioned, the
Arundel Manuscript has been indebted wholly from
p. 191 to p. 200 of this Volume. The Chronicle of
Hemingburgh, or Hemingford (edited by ΜΓ. Hamilton
for the English Historical Society 1848, 9), there can
hardly be a doubt, has been under equal obligations
to it. Tbat it is equally probable ton, that the Compiler
of the Arundel MS. resorted to Roger’s text and not to
that of Hemingburgh, may be inferred from the ⁸ fact
