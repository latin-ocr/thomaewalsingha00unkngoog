INTRODUC'I'ION.

 

m

THE. present Volume contains the earlier part· of the
Emylvzeh, Hieto‘tffes of Thomas Walsingham, Monk of
Saint Alban'S, A.D. 1272 ‘oo A.D. 1381: the remaining
portion of the work will appear in the succeeding

Volume.

'⁴' The Eme-2:310 History of Walsingham was first mmm
¹ published in the year 1574, under sshe auspices, if &hafflig-⁰?

not the immediate supervision, of Matthew Parker, ham’s His-

Archbishop of Canterbury3 and it again appeared, as m'y‘

part. of the Απρῑτῑοα, Ν manualem, H ibe‘mica, Ooem-
brioa, a Veteribus scripta, of William Camden‚ pub-
lished at Frankfort, (folio) in 1603. Τ118 typography
of Parker's text is very inaccurate, and the transcribet
of the manuscripta from which it is derived, whoever
118 (01· they) may have been, has done the work of
extension no better. · Camden's version is hardly a less
unfavourable specimen of printing, in point of accu-
racy, than Parker’s; perhaps more so. The Arch-
bishop's Volume, however, whether* by itself, .or in
combination with his 'edission of Asser’s Life of Alfrccl,
now 88118 at a high price ; as being a book rarity, no
doubt: Camden’s work, though a much larger volume,
is more moderate in price, though considerably in
excess of a 811111 which any but the wealthy or

enthusiastic book-collector would willingly afford.

The text of the present Edition is taken from a small Text of the
folio Manuecript, No· VII. in the Arundel Collection, in {2:532ss
