The horrowed context of MS. Harl. 655, already
mentioned, 1133 brought the History down to 13403
but here (p. 221), as previously noticed, the Compiler
reverts to the Saint Alban’s Manuscript, and takes it
up at the year 1337, occasionally (pp. 224, 5) inter-
weaving with its context matter common to MS. Harl.
655 and Hemingburgh. Having brought the narrative
borrowed from the Saint Alban's Chronicle down to
1340 (p. 228), 113 reverts to MS. Harl. 655, and tran-
scribes wholly from that source (with the exception of
a single extract from the Saint Alban’s Chronicle
inserted very needlessly in p. 230, and little else than
a repetition of what has been said from MS. Harl. 655

returns to the Saint Alban's Chronicle‚ going back to
1341, and does not abandon it to the conclusion of the
reign3 the Letter given in pp. 25 5-258 being common
to that Manuscript and the texts of MS. Harl. 655 and
Hemingburgh.

From 1345 (p. 265) down to 1365 (p. 301), the Com—
piler of the Saint Alban’s Chronicle has been indebted
at times to 3 ¹Manuscript now in the Cottonian Col-
lection, Cleopatra A. xvi.; or the two writers must have
horrowed from a common source. At the same point,
also, AD. 1345, the language of the so-called Continua-
tion of Marianum (edited by ΜΓ. Hog for the English
Historical Society in 1846) begins to correspond closely
with Walsingham's text, as drawn from the Saint
Alban’s Chronicle ; and continues to do so to the con-
clusion of the reign. That the Gompiler of the Gon⁴
