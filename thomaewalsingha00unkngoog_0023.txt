of the preceding year. In A.D. 1300 (p. 80) the Saint Souma-
Alban’s Manuscript begins to borrow matter from ffimsgfflch
other writers also, but continues in general to follow Albanjs
Rishanger down to 1306 (p. 109), where the most fflssffssssd
nearly complete Manuscript of Rishanger's Continuation ‘¹¹0 history,
(Ma Cotton. Faustina B. ix.) that seems. to be now 222⁰&
existing, ends abruptly from mutilation. How much Edward ¹·
lower in date Rishanger’s Chronicle may have come

down is uncertain. If, as seems not improbable, it
extended to the close of the reign of Edward 1„

it bore, probably, in its closing pages considerable
resemblance to the · ¹ Annales of his contemporary,‘ ”

N icholas Trivet3 which work (or else such lost portion

of Rishanger) has been largely drawn upon by the
Compiler of the Saint Alban's Chronicle in Aa).

1306, ’7 (pp. 109-116). The earliest instance in which

the Chronicle appears to have been indebted to Trivet

for matter not in Rishanger is in page 80, s. α. 1300.

Under the years 1306, ’7, the Compiler of the Saint
Alban's Chronicle, in addition to Trivet, borrows from
the ⁹ Flore& Historiarum os Matthew of westminster,
the ⁸ Chronica of Adam Murimuth, and the ‘¹ Comi-
nuation of Trivet's Annales ; or else the sources from
which those Compilations have respectively been derived.
The only portions in fact of the Chronicle‚ under this
reign, that appear not to be traceable to any older
work, with the exception of two or three unimportant
passages in pages 108, 110, and 111, are to be found
in pages 81-83, and 114-118. All passages of this
nature, it may be here remarked, will be readily dis-
tinguished by the reader, from the fact of their
