XX INTRODUCTION.

that in pp. 191 and 199 there are passages transcribed
from Roger of Chester’s text that have not been
adopted by Hemingburgh. At page 200 we find a
passage, which, though very similar to one derived
from the St. Alban’s Manuscript in p. 223, can be
traced probably to no known source, and must there-
fore be considered as original matter belonging bo
Walsingham. .

At the conclusion of Roget of Chester’s Chronicle in
1338, in MS. Harl. 655, the context is continued in 6
similar hand, but consisting, to a great extent, of
¹ Letters from King Edward 111„ the Pope, and other
personages. Of this Continuation also, the Compiler of
the Arundel Manuscript has equally availed himself,
between peges 200 and 221 ; and Hemingburgh has
done the same. We have the same reason too that has
been above mentioned, for coming to the conclusion
that the Compiler raeorted here to the text of MS. Harl.
655 and not of Hemingburgh3 as in pp. 215 and 216
we find passages introduced evidently from the Harleian
Manuscript, that are not to be found in Hemingburgh's
text. Indeed, on minute examination it would seem,
that there are fair grounds ‘for believing that MS. Harl.
655 is the identical copy that was employed by the
Compiler of the Arundel Manuscript.
